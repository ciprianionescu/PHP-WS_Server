PHP based class for instantiating WebSocket servers.
This class has support for hook-based Message Handlers which makes it easy to extend.

The included code also contains a demo.

This code is currently undocummented since it's work in progress but check back later for updates.

In order to test this, you need to start the server from command line using:

php ./server_test.php

while in the current folder.
